This datapack adds the deeper dark dimension, a new dimension consisting of sculk covered caverns filled with treasure and danger. The dimension adds new loot, new game mechanics, unique items, blocks, many advancements, new structures, enchantments and more. 


<details>
<summary>The Deeper Dark Dimension</summary>
  
The Deeper Dark is the new dimension this datapack adds, and is where most of the datapack's content is found. To enter the deeper dark, you must stand on reinforced deepslate in the portal structure in the center of an ancient city while holding an echo shard. Particles will appear showing you can enter. You can step into the portal and will be transported into the deeper dark. Once you enter the deeper dark, you will need to find another reinforced deepslate and hold your now-enchanted echo shard to leave. Just don't spawn the warden, because if there is a warden nearby, you cannot leave the dimension until it despawns or gets far enough away.

<summary>Biomes</summary>
  
<details>
<summary>Deeper Dark</summary>
  
The deeper dark biome is the main biome and most common biome in the dimension. It is very similar to the deep dark in the overworld, but with a few key differences. It has more sculk, fossils that contain diamonds, blue fog, sculk traps, and ancient villages. All overworld ores will spawn here, including emerald ore. All other biomes in the deeper dark are variants of this biome except the deep oasis.

<details>
<summary>The Volcanic Caverns</summary>
  
The volcanic caverns biome has basalt pillars, lava, magma blocks, gravel, tuff, and ancient debris. It is very similar to the basalt delta biome in the nether. At the center of the biome is a lava river/ravine.

</details>

<details>
<summary>The Amethyst Mines</summary>
  
The amethyst mines biome is covered in amethyst, calcite, and smooth basalt. On top of amethyst blocks, you can find calibrated sculk sensors. Since they are on top of amethyst blocks they will signal to other sensors and shriekers, and even cause chain reactions, but sculk sensors and shriekers spawn less frequently in this biome. Various mining suplies can be found around the biome. The only structure here is the amethyst mineshaft.

<details>
<summary>The Deep Oasis</summary>

The deep oasis is a calm sculk-free biome that spawns at the top of tall caves. Many plants live here, and giant vines hang down from the ceiling. sniffers and their plants will spawn here in sniffer nests; geode shaped caves made of moss and coarse dirt. Underneath this biome there are more shriekers than elsewhere in the deeper dark. No structures spawn in this biome.  Credit to peA_sh0ter for helping me design this biome.

<summary>The Ancient Dark</summary>

The ancient dark is the original home of the sculk. The biome is a large cavernous biome, with thin pillars and ledges. It is surrounded on all sides by an Obsidian Barrier The terrain has been completely converted to sculk several blocks deep and bone block stick up from the from the ground and hang down from the ceiling. The bottom of the biome has lava lakes with soul sand beaches. The biome has red fog and red-tinted water. The sculk in this biome is more advanced. In the ancient dark, sculk is also touch-sensitive. Touching any type of sculk alerts the biome and starts spawning wardens. Unique sculk blocks spawn here with unique abilities. This biome is extremely dangerous. The only structures here are laboratories.

Sculk traps consist of a disk of deepslate bricks supported by 4 pillars, on top there is a barrel, with 2 sensors and 2 shriekers next to it. The loot contains enchanted books, experience bottles, and an enchanted book with one of the first 4 new sculk-enchantments. They spawn in the volcanic caverns and deeper dark biomes.

<details>
<summary>Amethyst Mineshaft</summary>

The amethyst mineshaft spawns in the amethyst mines and can be found using an amethyst mineshaft locator compass. It is a series of wooden mineshaft tunnels connected to a stone center room with a staircase leading up to the top room. The top room has a domed ceiling, 4 side rooms, 4 hallways for housing, and a sculk conversion pedestal on top of the staircase. The 4 side rooms include a room with blast furnaces and chests, a room with a farm, a room with an animal pen, and a room with an auto respawn anchor and reinforced deepslate. There is a lot of loot in these structures, but be careful, there is a new mob in the mineshafts: The Shockwave. One shockwave is found on each floor (except the top room) and will stay on that floor. Shockwaves are really loud, strong, move really fast and wander around their floor. If you see or hear one close by, you need to go to a wall and surround yourself in blocks and wait for it to pass. Each floor of the mineshaft has an altar fragment, you need at least one to create a sculk converter, but you need 8 to fully power it.

<summary>Sculk Conversion</summary>

Sculk Conversion is a way to craft items using a sculk catalyst.
To create a sculk converter, drop altar fragments on a sculk catalyst (altar fragments are found in an amethyst mineshaft). Sculk converters need experience and soul fire to work. Surround them with soul fire in a circle, and kill mobs near it to give it xp. Every recipe needs different items, xp amounts, and soul fire amounts. The block will display the amount of xp (green bar) and soul fire (blue fires) it has. The block will try to convert every time it gets xp. Place items in the blue frame at the top of the altar. Once provided with the right resources, kill a mob near the converter and the item will convert after some time.

You can create a portal by first placing an enchanted echo shard in an item frame or glow item frame at the bottom of a reinforced deepslate portal in the deeper dark, and then killing a warden that is within 64 blocks of the item frame. The portal will take you to the location saved in the echo shard. If the echo shard links to a portal on the other side, it will attempt to light it.

Portals are experimental. If the portal is behaving strangely, there is a gamerule to disable it.
